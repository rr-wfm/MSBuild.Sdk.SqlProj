<!-- 
   This test project is designed to test a MSBuild.Sdk.SqlProj project with an explicit SDK reference. In order to build this project locally you will need to first
   run dotnet pack from the src/MSBuild.Sdk.SqlProj folder. This will create a .nupkg file containing the SDK in the bin folder. You will then have to add this folder
   as local NuGet feed using dotnet nuget feed add source -n LocalSdkFeed <path-to-bin-folder>. Finally you will need to change the SDK version below to match the created version.

   Note: This project is automatically build as part of CI so you'll rarely need to do this locally.
